        <description>The crash bug related to chrome has been solved.
            added a new param: GammaValueDW, only used in DW tweak. If left unset, it behaviors the same as previous
            release.
            Installer improved, no more file not found error. (You will still see this error when you upgrade from last
            release, but won't see it anymore in the future. 'cause this bug is caused by the uninstaller, not
            installer)
